Firefox OS Theme ~ Ligne
========================

Alternative theme for Firefox OS.

This repo was initially forked from [Building Blocks](https://github.com/buildingfirefoxos/Building-Blocks). The main folder in this repo "style" is bases itself on [Gaia](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia) CSS files.
The code you will find here could be useful to anyone interested in creating a Firefox OS application, but with a different look and feel.

You can find more information on how to use these files on [MDN's Building Blocks page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Design/Firefox_OS_building_blocks).
All examples showed there are also available inside "style" folder, but in a more friendly manner.


Cross browser support
-----------------------
Include `cross_browser.css` if you want your webapp can run on any modern browser.
Please test your app in your target browsers, as "style" folder is pulled automatically from the original source, if some styles changes before we have the change to update this file, we cannot guarantee it will always work as expected.


Install
----------

You can git clone the code from github `https://github.com/primearwyn/FirefoxOS-Theme-Ligne.git`
